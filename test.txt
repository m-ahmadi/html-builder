htmlbilder
===================

`htmlbilder` is a tool for creating one and only one HTML file, out of many Handelbars templates.

It mainly requires one thing, and that is a directory with a `main.handlebars` file in it.  
It then renders that template and will put the output in a HTML file.  
As you probably already know, in order to render a Handlebars (or Mustache) template, we need to pass a context object (data object) to it.
When `htmlbilder` is rendering the template: `main.handlebars` in let's say: `path/to/dir` folder,  
it searches for all the `.htm` files in that folder, and if it finds any,
it then passes the contents of each file as a property to the context-object.
It uses the name of the `.htm` file as the key, and contents of the file as the value of that property.
